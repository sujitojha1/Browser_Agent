      "text": "[trafilatura] One thing Im personally excited about is how tool-calling standards like MCP can actually make Ai Systems safer. With easier access to well-tested tools more companies can avoid reinventing the wheel, which reduces security risks and minimizes the chance of malicious code. As Ai systems start scaling in 2025, these are valid concerns.\nAs I dove into MCP, I realized a huge gap in documentation. Theres plenty of high-level what does it do content, but when you actually want to understand how it works, the resources start to fall shortespecially for those who arent native developers. Its either high level explainers or deep in the source code.\nIn this piece, Im going to break MCP down for a broader audiencemaking the concepts and functionality clear and digestible. If youre able, follow along in the coding section, if not it will be well explained in natural language above the code snippets.\nAn Analogy to Understand MCP: The Restaurant\nLets imagine the concept of MCP as a restaurant where we have:\nThe Host = The restaurant building (the environment where the agent runs)\nThe Server = The kitchen (where tools live)\nThe Client = The waiter (who sends tool requests)\nThe Agent = The customer (who decides what tool to use)\nThe Tools = The recipes (the code that gets executed)\nThe Components of MCP\nHost\nThis is where the agent operates. In our analogy, its the restaurant building; in MCP, its wherever your agents or LLMs actually run. If youre using Ollama locally, youre the host. If youre using Claude or GPT, then Anthropic or OpenAI are the hosts.\nClient\nThis is the environment that sends tool call requests from the agent. Think of it as the waiter who takes your order and delivers it to the kitchen. In practical terms, its the application or interface where your agent runs. The client passes tool call requests to the Server using MCP.\nServer\nThis is the kitchen where recipes, or tools, are housed. It centralizes tools so agents can access them easily. Servers can be local (spun up by users) or remote (hosted by companies offering tools). Tools on a server are typically either grouped by function or integration. For instance, all Slack-related tools can be on a Slack server, or all messaging tools can be grouped together on a messaging server. That decision is based on architectural and developer preferences.\nAgent\nThe brains of the operation. Powered by an LLM, it decides which tools to call to complete a task. When it determines a tool is needed, it initiates a request to the server. The agent doesnt need to natively understand MCP because it learns how to use it through the metadata associated with each of the tools. This metadata associated with each tool tells the agent the protocol for calling the tool and the execution method. But it is important to note that the platform or agent needs to support MCP so that it handles tool calls automatically. Otherwise it is up to the developer to write the complex translation logic of how to parse the metadata",

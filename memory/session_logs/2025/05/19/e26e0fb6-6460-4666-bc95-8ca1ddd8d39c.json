Drawing from past incidents and diplomatic developments, he pointed to multiple moments over the past two decades that have tested Indian public perception of the United States as a strategic partner.\nWhile India maintains steady and long-standing relationships with countries such as Russia and France, ties with the US have at times encountered turbulence.

The US responded with a diplomatic warning to India, while authorities in India stated that they were reviewing the shared intelligence.\nKugelmans comments also came in the backdrop of recent claims about former US President Donald Trumps involvement in India-Pakistan relations. According to reports, Trump intervened during a cross-border escalation between India and Pakistan, using trade-related pressure to influence Indias response. While a ceasefire was eventually agreed upon, his public assertion of credit reignited discussions about the consistency and reliability of the US as a strategic partner.\nOther analysts also weighed in.

Drawing from past incidents and diplomatic developments, he pointed to multiple moments over the past two decades that have tested Indian public perception of the United States as a strategic partner.\nWhile India maintains steady and long-standing relationships with countries such as Russia and France, ties with the US have at times encountered turbulence. Kugelman referred to this difference by describing Indias interactions with Russia and France as no-drama, in contrast to more complex and occasionally strained episodes with Washington.\nThereve been times over the last 2 decades when in India, public trust in US as a partner is called into question & contrasted w/Indias reliable, no-drama relationships w/Russia, France etc.\nKhobragade affair, late US response to India COVID crisis, Pannun.\nAnd right now.  Michael Kugelman (@MichaelKugelman) May 15, 2025\nIn each case, these moments have been smoothed over on policy levels. But public perceptions of the US and its reliability as evinced by some key Indian constituencies continues to be an issue that flares up periodically. Properly addressing this remains a work in progress.  Michael Kugelman (@MichaelKugelman) May 15, 2025\nHe cited a few examples  the 2013 Khobragade affair, in which Devyani Khobragade, then Indias deputy consul general in New York, was arrested on charges related to visa fraud. The incident had led to a diplomatic standoff and public outcry in India.\nAnother reference was made to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the US response to Indias health crisis drew criticism for its perceived delay. More recently, the Pannun case  a reported plot to assassinate Khalistani leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, allegedly involving Indian agents  resurfaced concerns about bilateral trust. The US responded with a diplomatic warning to India, while authorities in India stated that they were reviewing the shared intelligence.\nKugelmans comments also came in the backdrop of recent claims about former US President Donald Trumps involvement in India-Pakistan relations. According to reports, Trump intervened during a cross-border escalation between India and Pakistan, using trade-related pressure to influence Indias response. While a ceasefire was eventually agreed upon, his public assertion of credit reignited discussions about the consistency and reliability of the US as a strategic partner.\nOther analysts also weighed in. Strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney said the episode highlights broader concerns about strategic alignment.\nMeanwhile, former Pentagon official Michael Rubin said that Trumps comments may have economic repercussions, par",

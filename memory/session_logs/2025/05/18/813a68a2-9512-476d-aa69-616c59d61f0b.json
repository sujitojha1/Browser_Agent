Factory enhancements and the \"Cut the CoRRS\" campaign are reducing rework and improving efficiency. Fast F-15EX delivery is vital to replace aging F-15C/D fleets and maintain combat readiness amid global tensions, with the F-15EX able to carry 12 AIM-120 AMRAAMs. Tom Altamuro, Boeings director of F-15 manufacturing and safety, said factory performance is improving."

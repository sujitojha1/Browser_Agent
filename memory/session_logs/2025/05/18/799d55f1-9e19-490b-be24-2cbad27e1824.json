India is restricting Bangladeshi ready-made garment (RMG) exports to Kolkata and Nhava Sheva ports, and has barred consumer goods from entering through 11 land border posts. This action is reportedly in response to Bangladesh's own restrictions on Indian exports.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   **Goods Affected:** Restrictions impact goods like ready-made garments, wooden furniture, plastics, drinks, baked goods, and cotton yarn. Certain items like fish, LPG, edible oil, and crushed stone are excluded.\n*   **Reasons:** The restrictions appear to stem from strained relations and the end of a trans-shipment agreement. India cites concerns over Bangladesh's port restrictions hindering industrial growth in Northeast India. Some reports suggest the move is to \"promote Atmanirbhar Bharat\".\n*   **Ports:** The restrictions limit garment exports to Kolkata and Nhava Sheva seaports.

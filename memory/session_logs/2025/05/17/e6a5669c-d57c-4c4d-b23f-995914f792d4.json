India has a trade surplus with Turkey, exporting $5.2 billion (mineral fuels, auto parts, pharmaceuticals, cotton) and importing $2.84 billion (mineral oil, gold, marble, apples) during April-February 2024-25. Pune traders are refusing Turkish apples ($92.8 million in 2023), opting for alternatives from Himachal, Uttarakhand, and Iran, supported by Maharashtra's Deputy Chief Minister. This boycott is expected to impact Pune's fruit market, which has a seasonal turnover from Turkish apples between 1,000 crores to 1,200 crores. Travel to Turkey has also declined.",

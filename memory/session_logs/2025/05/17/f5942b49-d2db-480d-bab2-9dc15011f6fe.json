The S-Class is a few years into its latest generation, but Mercedes trotted out a new powertrain for 2023. Its not a full battery-electric vehicle, for that youll want the EQS, but for many consumers the plug-in hybrid can be a convenient stop-gap for those not ready to commit to leaving the gas station behind for good. | |\nReviews SummaryRedesigned for 2023, the 7 Series is BMW's full-size flagship sedan, arch-rival to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Audi A8, and newcomers like the Genesis G90. For 2024, BMW has added the plug-in hybrid (PHEV) 750e and lightly updated the infotainment system. Unfortunately, these additions don't change the 7 Series calculus. The 750e offers a boost in power and efficiency over the low-end 740i, but it costs more, has a disjointed driving personality, and quickly eats its electric charge. Despite the update, the car's digital systems remain frustratingly complex. Verdict: The 2024 BMW 7 Series has lots to offer luxury buyers, including features like a rear-seat theatre and cashmere upholstery, plus performance and fuel efficiency that are often superior to most rivals, few of whom offer PHEV options. But the car's frustrating digital systems and controls undermine the experience. | |\nNo video found | No video found |\nPopular Features & Specs | |\nEngine3.0L 429 hp I6 | Engine3.0L 375 hp I6 |\nDrive TrainAWD | Drive TrainRWD |\nSeating Capacity5 | Seating Capacity5 |\nHorsepower429 hp @ 6100 rpm | Horsepower375 hp @ 5200 rpm |\nMPG City20 | MPG City25 |\nMPG Highway28 | MPG Highway31 |\nEngine | |\nEngine Name3.0L 429 hp I6 | Engine Name3.0L 375 hp I6 |\nTorque384 lb-ft @ 1800 rpm | Torque398 lb-ft @ 1850 rpm |\nHorsepower429 hp @ 6100 rpm | Horsepower375 hp @ 5200 rpm |\nDrivetrainAWD | DrivetrainRWD |\nFuel Economy | |\nMPG City20 | MPG City25 |\nMPG Highway28 | MPG Highway31 |\nInterior | |\nLeather SeatsStandard | Leather Seats |\nSeating Capacity5 | Seating Capacity5 |\nKey Features | |\nNavigation SystemStandard | Navigation SystemStandard |\nSunroof/MoonroofStandard | Sunroof/MoonroofStandard |\nDimensions & Capacity | |\nCargo Space12.9 cu ft | Cargo Space19.1 cu ft |\nCurb Weight4740 lbs | Curb Weight4720 lbs |\nHeight59.2 in | Height60.8 in |\nLength208.2 in | Length212.2 in |\nWidth83.0 in | Width86.3 in |\nWheelbase126.6 in | Wheelbase126.6 in |\nMaximum Payload1387 lbs | Maximum Payload1098 lbs |\nNumber of doors4 | Number of doors4 |\nOverview | ||\nYears produced | 1994-Present | 1977-1979 |\nMSRP | $114,500 | $96,400 |\nAverage price | $49,491 | $39,045 |\nListings | ||\nRating",
